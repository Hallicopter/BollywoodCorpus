# BollywoodCorpus
#### A collection of plots from wikipedia of bollywood movies that are available on wikipedia.

##### Current status: Contains all available plot from 2006 to 2016.

The idea of this was to make cool graphs like this one:

But soon enough, I realised that my teeny corpus of around 805 films meant _squat_.
 The data was too little. Over time, the goal is to better this corpus, maybe to upgrade the source from wikipedia,
which in my opinion is the best at the moment. (Could be wrong.)

Also, there is a script to obtain more plots, which is quite self explanatory. There also exists another 
script in the repository which is my lame attempt at trying gain insights into bollywood. 

##### The only insight I gained was that this data set in its current state is worth its weight in dung.



#### IMPORTANT PS: Each plot is seperated by '-----------------------------------------------------------' as a delimiter.
